Very easy to sew shirt. I made sportswear out of it using breathable fabric.,0
"Beautiful cosmetic bag, the compartments give the bag a special touch.",0
A little bit of assembly of this model because the sewing margins are not included... it takes a while to make this model really big because you have to remove the assembly each piece. In my opinion the model is pleasant to the touch.,1

A yellow size, slightly or not visible
Slightly different impressions, complicated assembly. Very difficult ",2

Very bad instructions, I've sewn a few backpacks before but these instructions are useless!
Totally disappointed and a shame about the materials that are wasted when you then ",3

"I love it absolutely, great instructions ",0
"Nice jacket in itself. The facing on the collar is very difficult to cut out. I had to re-cut the fabric twice when cutting it out because the facing didn't fit at all. The lines are just too difficult to distinguish, even with color printing",1

The sweater is suitable for beginners as it comes with great instructions with pictures. I'm going to buy it again",0

The description for the pattern doesn't deserve to be called instructions. It's a shame about the money. I probably won't buy any more patterns from the designer. ",3
I love is easy instructions ,0
"I also fell for the picture. Reading it carefully would have cleared up the deception and I certainly wouldn't have bought the pattern. 
Size 62/68 says a baby, which isn't in the picture yet. I should have at least gotten a multi-size pattern.",0
Great instructions. Very well explained. The pattern was also suitable for a man's hat. I made a hat for a scarecrow out of it. ,0

It was easy to sew.
I think the crooked hem, i.e. one side longer than the other, is great! I didn't take the options into account in the pattern, but the result is great for me.",0
I sewed size 62. The waistband pattern is marked in the wrong place. Also the punching. And the stitching. This is not right. The bottom bottom is unrealistically high. I had to lower it by 5cm to get it right. The description is incomplete or not quite ri,3

A very nice cut! I sewed it for my cousin's daughter and they both thought it was great. I'll need a size bigger soon... ,0
"Worn size 40 for a long time. 42/44
I was always able to sew myself a size 38-40. And it fit perfectly. I hate puff sleeves, so a normal sleeve would have been great as a second option. One point deducted for that. Otherwise absolutely BRILLIANT :)",0

Cut exactly according to the size chart. Much too big. OK, so make it smaller again",2
"I basically like the cut. I find the heart shape very feminine and you can use the shirt to combine scraps you have lying around. I have now sewn 4 pieces and started another one.

But the instructions are confusing, when you get to the bottom of the shirt you can sew it.",0
